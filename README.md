# moviepolaroid.github.io
A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website that lets user create a movie polaroid. 
Haven't learned responsive web design yet. 
API: The Movie Database(TMBD)


LIMITATIONS:
- isn't responsive
- does not automatically add picture to the polaroid (the user must have the picture to be used saved in their computer so it can appear in the polaroid)



NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE.

must look like this, but it is not yet responsive:
